<h1>Welcome to the Programming Languages Repository</h1>

This repository contains about learning basics or fundamental to advanced with the most Object Oriented Programming Language like C++, Dart, Java and Python.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or forks this repository, then install compiler or sdk to compiled the code. Clone this repo by using the syntax below, then copy and paste on your terminal, make sure that you've already installed <a style = "text-decoration:none;" href = "https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> in your local system.
```
git clone https://github.com/BillyFrcs/ProgrammingLanguages.git
```

2. Visit the link below to download and install the compiler or sdk.
   - C++ [MinGw](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/)
